# Projects
I have highlighted a sample of work across various courses and other projects that should provide a full picture of the Data Science program at UC Berkeley.

## INCLUDED COURSEWORK

### CS 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs), Fall 2019<br/>
> First programming course, in Python (with some Scheme).<br/>
>
> - CATS implements an autocorrect for typing text, as well as a game for measuring typing speed.<br/>
>
> - Scheme follows the final 1/3 of the course, which studies the Scheme language in order to build a Scheme interpreter in Python.<br/>

### CS 61B (Data Structures), Spring 2020<br/>
> Second programming course, in Java.<br/>
> 
> - Enigma recreates the German Enigma machine from WW2.<br/>
>
> - Gitlet recreates many of the core features of Git, and contained zero skeleton code.<br/>

### CS 170 (Algorithms), Spring 2020<br/>
> Coursework consisted mostly of written problem sets, but there was one final programming project in Python.<br/>
> 
> - Project aims to build the best and most versatile solution to the Vertex Cover problem based on an expansive variety of unknown inputs.<br/>

### DATA 8 (Foundations of Data Science), Summer 2020<br/>
> Introductory data science course, in Python on Jupyter notebook.<br/>
> 
> - Project 1 uses global demographic data from gapminder.org to explore statistics and build visualizations.<br/>
>
> - Project 2 uses text from movie screenplays to build a KNN classifier to determine if a movie is a thriller or a comedy.<br/>

### DATA 100 (Principles and Techniques of Data Science), Fall 2020<br/>
> Upper-division/graduate-level data science course, in Python on Jupyter notebook.<br/>
> 
> - Project 1 uses restaurant food safety scores from the San Francisco Department of Public Health to perform exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.<br/>
>
> - Project 2 uses real email data to create and iterate on a classifier that distinguishes between good email (ham) and spam.<br/>
>
> - HW 8 explores Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.<br/>

### INDE 162 (Linear Programming), Spring 2021<br/>
> Uses AMPL, a math modeling language.<br/>
> 
> - Project uses a business case study to explore linear programming techniques to arrive at an optimal business strategy.<br/>

### CS 189 (Introduction to Machine Learning), Spring 2021<br/>
> Upper-division/graduate-level course, in Python.<br/>
> There were no major projects for this course. Instead, it was a mix of math problem sets and programming to implement ML algorithms and techniques.<br/>
> 
> - HW 5 explores decision trees and Random Forests.<br/>
>
> - HW 7 explores Singular Value Decomposition to build a movie recommender system.<br/>

### INFO 159 (Natural Language Processing), Spring 2021<br/>
> Upper-division/graduate-level course, in Python on Colab notebook.<br/>
> Like CS 189, there were no major projects, but larger HWs instead.<br/>
> 
> - HW 6 uses BERT for semantic role labeling.<br/>
>
> - HW 7 works on distant supervision and uses convolutional neural networks.<br/>


## OTHER WORK
### Microsoft x PiE Datathon, September 2020</br>
> https://www.facebook.com/events/585398912154696/</br>
> 
> Includes all work and the final presentation for the Microsoft x Pioneers in Engineering Datathon, where my team made the top 3 finalists.</br>
> None of the team had taken DATA 100 yet, so the techniques used were fairly simplistic, but we were able to leverage basic bootstrapping, regression, and A/B testing to arrive at a novel conclusion.</br>
